If the rate exceeds a predefined threshold, it flags a potential fault. This helps to detect sudden, drastic changes in sensor data that might indicate a malfunction.\n",

This is more robust to noise than simple range checks, allowing for gradual drifts or intermittent problems to be identified.  The function now includes a check to prevent division by zero if the standard deviation is zero.\n",
            "- **Consistency Checks:**  The `check_consistency` function compares readings from related sensors (e.g., GPS position and airspeed). Significant discrepancies might point toward a fault in one or both sensors. This requires careful tuning of the threshold based on the characteristics of the sensors and the system's operation.\n",

        "*   The `exponential_smoothing` function was implemented to handle historical readings, including `None` values.\n",
        "*   The main simulation loop was updated to calculate smoothed sensor values, generate predictions based on the last smoothed value, calculate prediction errors, and flag predictive anomalies if the error exceeds predefined thresholds.\n",
        "*   The `isolate_fault` function was modified to prioritize fault isolation to a sensor if a predictive anomaly is detected.\n",
        "*   The `handle_fault` function was updated to include specific responses for predictive anomalies, such as logging a warning and suggesting further diagnostic checks.\n",

        "*   The current implementation provides a basic framework for predictive fault detection using exponential smoothing. Further development should focus on tuning the smoothing factor (\\$\\alpha\\$) and prediction error thresholds based on real-world sensor data and flight conditions.\n",
        "*   Exploring more advanced time series models (e.g., ARIMA, LSTMs) and sensor fusion techniques would significantly enhance the predictive capabilities and potentially detect more subtle or complex impending faults. This would require addressing the limitation of the short historical data window by increasing the `maxlen` of the deques or implementing a more sophisticated data storage mechanism.\n"

            "### Model Architecture\n",
            "The chosen deep learning model is a `Sequential` model from Keras, designed for classifying sequences of sensor data. It consists of:\n",
            "- An **LSTM layer** with 64 units. LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks are a type of RNN particularly well-suited for processing sequential data like time series sensor readings because they can learn and remember patterns over time. The `input_shape` is set to match the shape of our input sequences (`X_train.shape[1:]`), which is (sequence_length, number_of_features). `return_sequences=False` is used because we are performing sequence-to-one classification (predicting a single label at the end of each sequence).\n",
            "- A **Dropout layer** with a rate of 0.2. Dropout is a regularization technique that randomly sets a fraction of input units to 0 during training. This helps prevent overfitting by making the network less reliant on specific neurons.\n",
            "- A **Dense output layer** with a number of units equal to the number of unique fault classes (`len(label_encoder.classes_)`). The 'softmax' activation function is used, which outputs a probability distribution over the possible fault classes. The class with the highest probability is the model's prediction.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Model Compilation\n",
            "The model is compiled with:\n",
            "- The **'adam' optimizer**, a popular and generally effective optimization algorithm for deep learning models.\n",
            "- **'sparse_categorical_crossentropy' loss function**. This is the appropriate loss function for multi-class classification when the labels are integers (as they are after using `LabelEncoder`).\n",
            "- **'accuracy' as the evaluation metric**. This tracks the proportion of correctly classified sequences during training and evaluation.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Training Process\n",
            "The model was trained for 20 epochs with a batch size of 32. A validation split of 0.2 was used, meaning 20% of the training data was held out for validation during training. The training progress, including the loss and accuracy on both the training and validation sets, was printed during each epoch.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Evaluation Results\n",
            "The trained model was evaluated on the unseen test dataset (`X_test`, `y_test`). The results show:\n",
            "- **Test Loss:** 0.0625\n",

            "The **Classification Report** provides detailed metrics for each fault class and the overall model performance:\n",

            "- **Recall:** The proportion of correctly predicted instances of a class out of all actual instances of that class.\n",
            "- **F1-score:** The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of the model's performance.\n",

            "\n",

To fix this, the `current_consistency_states` dictionary needs to be passed as an argument to the `isolate_fault_comprehensive` function. Also, the `fillna` method calls should be updated to use the recommended `ffill()` and `bfill()` methods directly to address the `FutureWarning`. The `UserWarning` from `StandardScaler` and `IsolationForest` regarding feature names can be ignored as they do not affect the functionality in this context.\n",

        "## Explanation of New Anomaly Detection Methods\n",
        "\n",
        "### ML-Based Anomaly Detection (Isolation Forest)\n",
        "\n",
        "We've introduced an **Isolation Forest** model as an example of an ML-based anomaly detection technique. Here's how it works and why it's useful:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **How it Works:** Isolation Forest works by randomly selecting a feature and then randomly selecting a split value between the maximum and minimum values of that selected feature. This process recursively partitions the data. Anomalies are typically few and different from normal observations, making them easier to isolate. The number of splits required to isolate a data point is a measure of its abnormality. Data points that require fewer splits to be isolated are considered more likely to be anomalies.\n",
        "*   **Training:** The model is trained on a dataset of *normal* sensor readings. It learns the characteristics of what constitutes \"normal\" behavior for the system based on the relationships between different sensor readings.\n",
        "*   **Detection:** During the simulation, the current sensor readings (as a single data point across all features) are fed into the trained Isolation Forest model. The model outputs an anomaly score or a prediction (-1 for anomaly, 1 for normal). If the prediction is -1, it indicates that the current state of the system, based on the combined sensor readings, is significantly different from the normal behavior the model learned.\n",
        "*   **Benefits:**\n",
        "    *   **Efficiency:** Isolation Forest is generally efficient and scalable, even for datasets with many features.\n",
        "    *   **Effective for Outliers:** It's particularly good at detecting distinct outliers.\n",
        "    *   **Unsupervised:** It doesn't require labeled data for anomalies, only examples of normal behavior.\n",
        "*   **Limitations:**\n",
        "    *   **Defining \"Normal\":** Its performance depends heavily on the quality and representativeness of the \"normal\" data used for training. If the training data doesn't cover all normal operating conditions, it might flag legitimate variations as anomalies.\n",
        "    *   **Parameter Tuning:** The `contamination` parameter (estimating the proportion of anomalies in the data) needs careful tuning.\n",
        "    *   **Not Fault Classification:** It detects *anomalies* in the system state but doesn't inherently tell you *which sensor* is causing the anomaly or the *type* of fault. This still requires integration with fault isolation logic.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Consistency Checks with Thresholds and Hysteresis\n",
        "\n",
        "We've enhanced the consistency checks to include configurable thresholds and hysteresis. This makes them more robust to noisy data and prevents rapid toggling between states (\"chattering\").\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **How it Works:**\n",
        "    *   **Comparison:** It compares the readings of two related sensors (e.g., GPS latitude and airspeed in our simplified example, though a more realistic check would be GPS ground speed vs airspeed under specific conditions, or comparing redundant sensors).\n",
        "    *   **Difference Calculation:** The absolute difference between the two readings is calculated.\n",
        "    *   **Thresholds:** Instead of a single threshold, we use two: a `warning_threshold` and a `critical_threshold`.\n",
        "    *   **Hysteresis:** Hysteresis introduces a \"lag\" in the state change. To transition from a higher alert state (e.g., 'warning' or 'critical') back to a lower state (e.g., 'normal' or 'warning'), the difference between the readings must drop *below* the threshold for the lower state minus the hysteresis value. This prevents the state from rapidly switching if the difference hovers around a threshold due to noise.\n",
        "    *   **States:** The check maintains a state ('normal', 'warning', 'critical', 'cannot_check'). The state transitions based on the difference and the current state, incorporating the hysteresis logic.\n",
        "*   **Integration:** In the simulation loop, we now perform this enhanced consistency check for the defined sensor pairs and update the `detection_results` with the current state of each check.\n",
        "*   **Benefits:**\n",
        "    *   **Robustness:** Hysteresis significantly reduces false alarms caused by noisy data or minor fluctuations near a threshold.\n",
        "    *   **Graduated Alerts:** Using warning and critical thresholds allows for a more nuanced response to inconsistencies.\n",
        "    *   **Physically Interpretable:** Consistency checks often compare physically related quantities, which can be easier to interpret than abstract anomaly scores.\n",
        "*   **Limitations:**\n",
        "    *   **Requires Related Sensors:** Only applicable when there are physically related or redundant sensor measurements available.\n",
        "    *   **Threshold Tuning:** Requires careful tuning of warning, critical, and hysteresis thresholds based on sensor specifications and expected operational variations.\n",
        "    *   **Doesn't Isolate Fault:** Like basic anomaly detection, a consistency check failure indicates an issue *between* two sensors, not necessarily which one is faulty. Fault isolation is still needed.\n",

        "\n",
        "We've implemented a risk matrix and fault classification system to prioritize detected issues based on their potential severity. This is a common practice in safety-critical systems to ensure that the most dangerous faults receive immediate attention and appropriate responses.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Risk Levels\n",
        "\n",
        "We defined several risk levels, each associated with a numerical value for internal use and a descriptive term:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Normal (0):** No significant risk detected.\n",
        "*   **Low (1):** Minor impact, unlikely to occur frequently.\n",
        "*   **Medium (2):** Moderate impact or higher likelihood of a minor impact fault.\n",
        "*   **High (3):** Significant impact or likely to occur frequently.\n",
        "*   **Critical (4):** Catastrophic impact, regardless of likelihood, or highly likely major impact.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "### Likelihood and Impact Assessment\n",
        "\n",
        "To determine the risk level, we estimated the **likelihood** and **impact** of each specific fault type simulated in our system:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Likelihood:** An estimation of how often a particular fault is expected to occur (e.g., Rare, Unlikely, Possible, Likely, Frequent). These are based on hypothetical assumptions about sensor reliability in our simulation. In a real system, these would be informed by historical data, manufacturer specifications, and operational experience.\n",
        "*   **Impact:** An assessment of the potential consequences of a fault on the VTOL's mission, safety, and functionality (e.g., Negligible, Minor, Moderate, Major, Catastrophic). These are also hypothetical in our simulation but would be based on detailed system analysis in a real-world scenario.\n",

        "\n",
        "While the simulation's fault handling responses are still basic, they now include the identified risk level (e.g., \"Response (Risk: Critical): ...\"). This demonstrates how a real system would use the risk classification to trigger appropriate actions, with higher-risk faults leading to more immediate and severe responses.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",

        "*   **Green:** Normal, Low\n",
        "*   **Orange:** Medium\n",

        "*   **Gray:** Unknown\n",
        "\n",
        "In a real-world user interface or logging system, these colors could be used to visually highlight the severity of detected faults, allowing operators to quickly identify and prioritize critical issues. While we don't have a graphical interface in this Colab notebook, the `risk_colors` dictionary is available for potential future visualization implementations.\n",
        "\n",
        "This risk-based approach provides a more structured and effective way to manage faults in a defense VTOL, ensuring that responses are proportional to the potential consequences."

To fix this, `sampling_rate` needs to be passed as an argument to the sensor simulation functions, or accessed as a global variable. Since `current_sim_time`, `airspeed_failed_time`, `current_drift_values`, and `intermittent_cycle_states` are already global and managed by the loop, making `sampling_rate` global as well is a consistent approach for this simulation structure. The code needs to be regenerated with this fix.\n",
