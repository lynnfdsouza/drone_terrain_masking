        "The previous code block failed because it tried to run an asyncio loop when one was already running. This is a common issue in environments like Colab. The fix is to only use `loop.run_until_complete(main())` if a loop is already running, and use `asyncio.run(main())` otherwise, which is what the current code attempts, but it seems to be failing on the check itself. A more robust approach in interactive environments is to check if a loop is running and if so, use `nest_asyncio` or similar, or just directly await the `main()` coroutine if possible, but the simplest fix for this specific error in many interactive environments is to simply run `await main()` if a loop is already running, and `asyncio.run(main())` otherwise. Given the error trace, it seems the `try...except RuntimeError` block is not correctly handling the case where `asyncio.get_running_loop()` raises the `RuntimeError`. Let's simplify the execution logic for interactive environments.\n",

        "# 1. Data Needed for Training a Real ML Threat Model:\n",
        "# To train a real ML threat model, a dataset of historical mission or surveillance data is required.\n",
        "# This dataset should contain sensor readings (similar to the enhanced SensorData structure)\n",
        "# paired with a target variable representing the actual threat level encountered or the outcome\n",
        "# of the mission segment in that sensor environment.\n",
        "# Specific data points needed would include:\n",
        "# - Radar data: Number of contacts, signal strength, frequency information, track data (if available).\n",
        "# - Infrared data: Number of heat signatures, temperature profiles, movement patterns.\n",
        "# - Acoustic data: Loudness, frequency spectrum analysis, identification of specific sounds.\n",
        "# - Electronic Warfare data: Types of signals detected (jamming, radar lock, communication), signal strength, direction finding.\n",
        "# - Contextual data: Location (terrain type, known enemy positions), time of day, weather conditions.\n",
        "# - Target Variable: A quantifiable measure of threat (e.g., a continuous threat score 0-1, or categorical labels like Low/Medium/High Threat, or event-based outcomes like \"engaged by enemy\", \"mission successful/failed due to threat\").\n",
        "\n",
        "# 2. Potential Machine Learning Models:\n",
        "# Suitable ML models for threat assessment based on this type of sensor data could include:\n",
        "# - Classification Models: If the threat is categorized (e.g., Low/Medium/High). Examples: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests, Gradient Boosting Machines (like XGBoost or LightGBM), or simple Neural Networks.\n",
        "# - Regression Models: If the threat is a continuous score. Examples: Linear Regression, Ridge/Lasso Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forests Regressor, Neural Networks.\n",
        "# - Time Series Models: If threat assessment needs to consider temporal patterns in sensor data. Examples: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), LSTMs, or time series specific models like ARIMA (though less common for diverse sensor fusion).\n",
        "# - Anomaly Detection Models: To identify unusual sensor patterns that might indicate a new or unforeseen threat. Examples: Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM.\n",

        "# - Data Collection and Cleaning: Gather historical sensor data and associated threat labels/outcomes. Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.\n",
        "# - Feature Engineering: Transform raw sensor data into features suitable for the ML model. This might involve aggregating time-series data (e.g., average radar strength over a time window), extracting statistical features (e.g., variance of acoustic data), and encoding categorical data (e.g., one-hot encoding for EW signal types).\n",

        "# - Model Training: Train the selected model(s) on the training data.\n",
        "# - Model Evaluation and Tuning: Evaluate the trained model's performance on the validation set using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score for classification; Mean Squared Error, R-squared for regression). Tune hyperparameters to optimize performance.\n",
        "# - Final Testing: Assess the performance of the best model on the unseen test set.\n",
        "# - Model Saving: Save the trained model in a format suitable for loading and inference (e.g., joblib for scikit-learn, TensorFlow SavedModel).\n",

        "# - The _preprocess_for_ml method would be implemented to transform the SensorData object into the specific feature vector format expected by the trained model. This method needs to be robust and handle the different data types and structures within SensorData.\n",
        "# - The assess_threats method would be modified to call _preprocess_for_ml, feed the resulting features into self.threat_model.predict(), and use the model's output as the primary threat level. The rule-based approach could potentially be kept as a fallback or combined with the ML output.\n",
        "\n",

        "# - Feature Engineering Complexity: Transforming raw, multi-modal sensor data into meaningful features for an ML model can be complex.\n",
        "# - Real-time Inference: The model needs to be efficient enough to make predictions quickly in real-time during mission execution. Model size and computational requirements are important considerations.\n",

        "#    - A* Algorithm (3D Extension): The A* algorithm is well-suited for 3D grids. The heuristic function would need to be extended to 3D (e.g., Euclidean distance in 3D). The cost function would consider movement in 3D space and traversability/cost of voxels.\n",
        "#    - RRT/RRT* (Rapidly-exploring Random Trees): These sampling-based algorithms are effective for high-dimensional spaces and can handle complex obstacles. They explore the space by incrementally building a tree of possible paths. RRT* is an optimized version that finds asymptotically optimal paths.\n",

        "#        - Update `set_terrain_data`: Convert terrain data (plus obstacle and airspace data) into a 3D traversability matrix or cost map. This requires defining the height resolution of the voxel grid and mapping real-world 3D space to voxel indices.\n",

        "#    - Computational Cost: 3D pathfinding, especially on fine-grained voxel grids, can be computationally expensive and memory-intensive compared to 2D. Performance optimization (e.g., using coarser grids, hierarchical pathfinding, or optimizing the search) is crucial for real-time applications.\n",
        "#    - Data Resolution and Accuracy: The resolution of terrain and obstacle data directly impacts the accuracy and feasibility of the 3D path. Inaccurate data can lead to collisions or non-optimal paths.\n",

        "#    - Path Smoothing: Paths generated by grid-based pathfinding can be jagged. Post-processing to smooth the path while avoiding obstacles is necessary for realistic drone movement.\n",
