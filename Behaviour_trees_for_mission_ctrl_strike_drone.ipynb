        "The error `IndexError: list index out of range` occurs because the node logs (`engage_target_sequence.log` and `patrol_node.log`) are being cleared at the end of *each* simulation step within the `collect_logs` function. When the analysis code tries to access `log[-1]`, the list is empty. The logging mechanism needs to be adjusted to append to a central list for the scenario within the nodes themselves, or the logs should be collected differently without clearing them immediately. A better approach is to let the nodes append to their own logs, and then collect all logs at the end of the simulation for that scenario. Also, the `sim_env` status at the end of the loop is the correct indicator, not necessarily the last logged status of individual nodes. The analysis should primarily use the collected `df_ticks` DataFrame.\n",
